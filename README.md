# CIS 519 Final Project

The code was implemented on different systems (Windows, MacOS) so it might be hard to run the code until you adjust some of them.


## step\_0\_1\_Bird Attributes
This folder contains the code about how we collect the attributes of 175 seen bird species. We manually collect the attributes of the remaining 25 unseen bird species from online resources.


## step\_0\_2\_Preprocess Images
This folder contains the code about how we preprocess all the images. Basically, we resize all images to `121 * 264`, which is the smallest size in the dataset. The DataLoader is also presented in this folder.

## step\_1\_CNN
This folder contains the code about our CNN model.

## step\_2\_Classification
This folder contains the code about how we adjust the weight of each attributes. 

## predict
This note book contains how we predict the final result.
